# Week 02 - Iteration, Greyboxing and Playtesting
Today we will be getting familiar with the use of iterative design in our game making process. We will be introducing you to the idea of playtesting and experience goals to achieve this.

Note: Formal procedures for Quality Assurance and Playtesting exist and are an important part of game design that you will be using later in this unit. For now, however, we are going to focus on familiarising ourselves with these ideas from a more general perspective. If you find this process interesting, keep an eye out for our playtesting-focused week later in semester!

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity

## Assignment deliverable
There is no direct assignment deliverable today. However, your iteration on your scene from last week will help you get a better grip on how to think about designing your level for particular experiences, and expose you to the process of playtesting. These skills will be necessary for the Level Design Task.


## Internal playtest/Quality Assurance (30 min)
### Retrieving your project from last week
Instead of creating a new scene today, you'll be iterating on what you built last week. If you have not created any sort of level from last week, spend some time doing so now. You may even want to revisit last week's sheet for some ideas.

If you haven't got it, clone/pull the latest version of your lab repo from last week. Take a minute or so to refresh your memory of the project. Consider some of the big-picture design qualities of your level:

* Does the player know where they are going?
* Are there any "leaps of faith" or other times the player can't see where they are jumping to?
* Are all the jumps or other necessary movements reasonably possible? If not, why?

These questions are a bit hard to answer without any data. So it is time to play our game and start iterating!

You will want to be taking notes throughout this lesson. We highly recommend you place your notes in the repo along with your project, such as adding a markdown file, a text file, or taking notes in a design journal you keep with you when working. 

Whatever you do, the important thing is that you are recording your design process, as this will be a core skill for you as a designer.

### Internal playtest/Quality Assurance
Let's begin by playing our level ourselves. In this initial play through, we're looking for any "bugs" in the level design: are there jumps that can't be made? Are there any opportunties for the player to get stuck and unable to progress? Having had a week-or-so from when you last played with this project, you should now be able to come at it with fresh eyes.

Make some notes on what needs to be changed to make your game playable. You could also consider things like what the player is able to see at any time, how confusing the level is, etc.

### First iteration
Depending on how buggy your game is, this might take longer. That's ok! When giving the game to external playtesters, you don't want them to come back and tell you they couldn't play your game because of a bug.

## External playtest 1 (30 min)
Questions about the experience of playing the game are hard to answer on our own, so it is time for some external playtesting!

### Experience Goals and Design Questions
Before passing the game onto another player, you'll need some idea of the design questions you are trying to answer. Start thinking about higher-level experience goals. While we'll dive into this in later weeks, consider:

* Are you trying to make a challenging level? If so, what kind of challenge? Is it about quick reflexes and movement, or slow and deliberate path-choosing?
* Do you instead want to make a more "chill" and exploratory experience, with more spaces for the player to take their time and enjoy the vibe?

Take a look at Quantic Foundary's Gamer Motivation Model (avaliable in the lecture slides) and select onr or two of these catergoies (Action, Mastery, Achievement, etc) to focus your design on.

Jot down three questions that you will ask your player about these. They don't need to be too structured at this stage, but should avoid direct reference to your experience goals. For example:

* Instead of asking "Did the game have enough excitement?" ask "What were you feeling during the pitfall at the end?"

* Instead of asking "Did the game hit the target of mastery?" ask "Were there any parts of the level that made you slow down and think? If so, which sections?

This is a good way of getting more nuanced data that reveals not only whether things are working or not, but experiences you yourself may have not discovered yet!

### Swapping games
Find a peer to swap with, playing each other's games. While playing your peer's game, do so in good faith: Don't just blitz through, but instead try to really think about your experience as you play. Remember, you want to be able to give them good feedback on their game that will help them improve.

Once you've both played each other's games, discuss. Describe your experience and findings with your partner about their level, and make sure you are noting down anything they have to say about yours. Pay special attention to anything they say that you didn't notice about your level.

### Second iteration
With this feedback in mind, start iterating on your level.

Focus on ways you can address any of the issues that arose from your playtest. For instance, a section that was meant to be challenged that was breezed through might need to be made a bit harder, or the path to the end might have been too hard to find.

On the flipside, consider how you can also leverage the good things about your level. Were there particularly exciting sections for your player? What made them so engaging, and how can you make the rest of your level like that? Did they point out something new you hadn't considered?

It's ok to revisit your experience goals at this stage. Iteration often involves going back-and-forth between documentation, prototypes and the game itself.

Once you are happy with what you've made, make sure you save and push your repo. Add a meaningful commit message regarding how you've adapted the feedback given. If you're recording your notes inside your repo as we recommend, make sure you push them as well.

## External playtest 2: Target Audience (30 mn)
### Audience persona
In your next iteration, try narrowing things down to the qualities of your target audience. Start crafting a persona for your target audience based on your experience goals. Remember, "18-25 year old males" isn't a useful target audience, as it says nothing of someone's attributes or desires. Instead, write a short blurb reflecting one of your ideal players. See the lecture notes for examples of what these blurbs should look like. Remember, your ideal player might be nothing like you!

Again, craft a couple of questions that you think will help you test that you've made a game "for" your ideal player. For instance, if they are into games that require quick reflexe, you could ask them if they found any part of the game particularly hard, what kind of skills they thought they needed, etc.

### Swapping games
Swap with another peer. You are unlikely to find your exact "ideal" player in the room, but ask a couple of questions to see if you can find someone with a few things in common with your ideal player.

You may be able to do a swap like last time, but might find you are the ideal player for someone else instead. Importantly, try to playtest at least one other student's game.

Once you've done your playtesting, make sure you interview your player and collect data, and allow yourself to be interviewed by the person whose game you played.

### Third iteration
Based on this round of feedback (as well as your experience of playing other games!) start making some more changes. Once again, consider both the good and bad about your level. If all the feedback was positive, try and understand why and keep building out your level. If it turns out your level totally missed the mark, don't be discouraged - this is an important part of the process!

Again, push your changes with meaningful commit messages.

## Reflection and further iteration (Remaining time)
If you have time, keep playtesting and iterating. You should by now have some understanding of how you can use reflection and feedback to iterate on your level, refining the experience for the player. 

Take a moment to compare the level you started this class with and the level you have now by taking a screenshot (just as you did last week). If you didn't take a screenshot, you can check out the version of your repo from the start of today to compare the scenes (another good reason to push regularly!).

This is all very introductory in terms of how playtesting, experience goals and target audiences work. We will be getting deeper into the relevant design theory and practice as semester progresses.

## Next Week
Next week we will be shifting our focus to looking at the "toy" within the 2D Tool Kit, namely the Ellen avatar and how she can interact with the world. See you then!
