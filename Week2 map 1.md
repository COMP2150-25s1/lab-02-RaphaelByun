Retrieving your project from last week
Does the player know where they are going?

The player will know where they are going due to the fact that other path are blocked, making this stage into a tutoral means that it needs to show the exact place where the player should go, will change that.

Are there any leaps of faith or other ties the player can;t see wheere they are jumping to.

No there is none like that, only jumps that the player can see

no

Are there any opportunitis for the player to get stuck and unable to progress?
No, they can get stuck going backwards but going to the right will be blocked on certain jumps, making it certain where to progress

Yes they can, no cut off's and no leap of faiths

Progression is always possible except for the door? can not really use it.
