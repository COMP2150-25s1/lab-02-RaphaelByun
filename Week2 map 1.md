Retrieving your project from last week
Does the player know where they are going?

The player will know where they are going due to the fact that other path are blocked, making this stage into a tutoral means that it needs to show the exact place where the player should go, will change that.

Are there any leaps of faith or other ties the player can;t see wheere they are jumping to.

No there is none like that, only jumps that the player can see

Are all the jumps or other necessary movements reasonablly possible 

yes they are, most of the are easy jumps and even if they fall into the one hole, they are able to jump up by holding space for a longer time.


-----------------------------------------------------------
Internal QA

Are there jumps that can't be made?
no

Are there any opportunitis for the player to get stuck and unable to progress?
No, they can get stuck going backwards but going to the right will be blocked on certain jumps, making it certain where to progress


Can the player always see what they need to see? Does the camer ever "cut off" important information?
Yes they can, no cut off's and no leap of faiths

are there any other mechanical issues with your level that prevent the player from progressing, or cause the system to act in unexpected ways?
Progression is always possible except for the door? can not really use it.

---------------------------------------------------
Mastery, Discovery (?)

Do they think that this is a tutorial level?

Yes, the play tester said that this is about a stage 1 - stage 2 level, making sure that people will learn how high and how long they can jump

Was it easy enough for anyone who just started playing any video games to be able to play this game? 


Is the background enough to keep people focused onto the level?
Kinda? They said that it is a very early stage, but we can always keep on going.


Was the background expressive, do you think you were exploring an early levels?

Do you think this is a Tutorial level?

Thinking this as a tutorial level, do you think that you will need more mastery to go into a more challenging level?


Audience persona
A idel persona is people who wants to just relax on a platformer or people who just started playing the game. If they like small story telling within the world or even how ellen ended up in this kind of world. (Exploration), If challenge off the get go is what they want, this game will not be for them as this targets who wants to slowly get better and better. This is a great game for phone, handheld console or even pc. story/ play time would be around about 3-4 hours

Persona

Motivation: Immersion, Creativity, Achievement.

They are a person who loves a story game but with some interative into it. As they enjoy a story game, they hate challange from the start which might stop them progressing the story. They have around about 30 minutes to an hour to play games, and only on their phone. Making this 
game a great way to end the day.
