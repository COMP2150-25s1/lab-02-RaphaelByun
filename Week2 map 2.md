Are there any leaps of faith or other ties the player can't see where they are jumping to.

No there is none like that, only jumps that the player can see

-----------------------------------------------------------
Internal QA

Are there jumps that can't be made?


Are there any opportunitis for the player to get stuck and unable to progress?



Can the player always see what they need to see? Does the camer ever "cut off" important information?


are there any other mechanical issues with your level that prevent the player from progressing, or cause the system to act in unexpected ways?
